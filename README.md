# Jupyter playground

Just playing around with jupyter notebooks, some financial modeling, and maybe tinkering with some AI stuff.

## Requirements

1. Clone mnitchie/python_sandbox
2. `make build` in `python_sandbox`

You should only need to do the above once.
That will generate a basic image with minimal required bits (notebook, pandas etc...) already installed.

OR, you can take the requirements_jupyter.txt from that repo and go your own way.

## Getting started

If you followed the instructions above, simply `make start`
